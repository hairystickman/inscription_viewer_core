 About this Prototype
 -------------------

 Usage
 ========
 Use and modify as you like. This is provided with no guarantees and is very much a work in progress.
 Please be sure to respect any 3rd part content used here.


 Origins
 =========
 How can 3D publishing programs work hand-in-hand to augment traditional 2D print publications?


 Can one publish a descriptive volume in a modular format that is both visually cohesive and functional and that doesn’t require all of the other component parts to be there first?


 The effort to answer these questions – a series of ongoing conversations and collaboration between colleagues - has resulted in this open source web-based experimental viewer. It presents a platform for presenting contextual geospatial relationships (in 3D) and examination of their surface details (in 2D).


 This prototype tool marries 2D imagery and 3D models with available linked data. It is built around the open source <a href="https://iiif.io"> IIIF</a> format, using <a href="https://openseadragon.github.io">OpenSeaDragon</a> and <a href="https://sketchfab.com/developers">SketchFab API</a>, integrating current best practice documentation techniques with archival imagery from the Epigraphic Survey’s Photo Archive, Large Format Collection & <a href="https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/oip/medinet-habu-ix-eighteenth-dynasty-temple-part-i-inner-sanctuaries">OIP 136 Medinet Habu IX. The Eighteenth Dynasty Temple, Part I: The Inner Sanctuaries With Translations of Texts, Commentary, and Glossary</a>

 Futures
 ==============

 This is the latest iteration, whose origins can be read about <a href="https://www.digital-epigraphy.com/projects/documenting-the-amenhotep-iii-wall-scene-ld177-at-luxor-temple-part-4-from-model-creation-to-presentation" > here </a>.
  Past <a href="https://ommphoto.ca/openseadragon_test/inscription_viewer.html"> incarnations </a> experiment with content from the tomb of Qar and Idu, and a digital publication can be found <a href="https://www.digital-epigraphy.com/publications/the-mastabas-of-qar-and-idu-g-7101-and-7102-digitally-revised-and-enhanced-edition">here</a>.


 This remains an early concept piece, and has not been widely tested nor is it yet optimized for mobile and accessibility standards.

   ========
   All code is open source but any textual and image data presented remains the copyright of <a href="https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/projects/epigraphic-survey"> Epigraphic Survey & The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago</a> in cooperation with the <a href="https://egymonuments.gov.eg"> Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities</a>



   The interface is built with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/">BootStrap 5.0</a>; 3D interactions are derived from the <a href="https://sketchfab.com/developers">SketchFab API</a> as well as customized code. This demo uses <a href="https://openseadragon.github.io">OpenSeaDragon</a> version.2.4.2 with a modified version of the excellent openseadragon-curtain-sync along with code adapted from:
